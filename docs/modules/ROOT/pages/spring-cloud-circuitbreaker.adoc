= Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker

Spring Cloud Circuit breaker provides an abstraction across different circuit breaker implementations.
It provides a consistent API to use in your applications, letting you, the developer, choose the circuit breaker implementation that best fits your needs for your application.

[[supported-implementations]]
== Supported Implementations

Spring Cloud supports the following circuit-breaker implementations:

* https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j[Resilience4J]
* https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel[Sentinel]
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry]

[[core-concepts]]
== Core Concepts

To create a circuit breaker in your code, you can use the `CircuitBreakerFactory` API.
When you include a Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker starter on your classpath, a bean that implements this API is automatically created for you.
The following example shows a simple example of how to use this API:

[source,java]
----
@Service
public static class DemoControllerService {
	private RestTemplate rest;
	private CircuitBreakerFactory cbFactory;

	public DemoControllerService(RestTemplate rest, CircuitBreakerFactory cbFactory) {
		this.rest = rest;
		this.cbFactory = cbFactory;
	}

	public String slow() {
		return cbFactory.create("slow").run(() -> rest.getForObject("/slow", String.class), throwable -> "fallback");
	}

}
----

The `CircuitBreakerFactory.create` API creates an instance of a class called `CircuitBreaker`.
The `run` method takes a `Supplier` and a `Function`.
The `Supplier` is the code that you are going to wrap in a circuit breaker.
The `Function` is the fallback that is run if the circuit breaker is tripped.
The function is passed the `Throwable` that caused the fallback to be triggered.
You can optionally exclude the fallback if you do not want to provide one.

[[circuit-breakers-in-reactive-code]]
=== Circuit Breakers In Reactive Code

If Project Reactor is on the class path, you can also use `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory` for your reactive code.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java]
----
@Service
public static class DemoControllerService {
	private ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory cbFactory;
	private WebClient webClient;


	public DemoControllerService(WebClient webClient, ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory cbFactory) {
		this.webClient = webClient;
		this.cbFactory = cbFactory;
	}

	public Mono<String> slow() {
		return webClient.get().uri("/slow").retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class).transform(
		it -> cbFactory.create("slow").run(it, throwable -> return Mono.just("fallback")));
	}
}
----

The `ReactiveCircuitBreakerFactory.create` API creates an instance of a class called `ReactiveCircuitBreaker`.
The `run` method takes a `Mono` or a `Flux` and wraps it in a circuit breaker.
You can optionally profile a fallback `Function`, which will be called if the circuit breaker is tripped and is passed the `Throwable`
that caused the failure.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

You can configure your circuit breakers by creating beans of type `Customizer`.
The `Customizer` interface has a single method (called `customize`) that takes the `Object` to customize.

For detailed information on how to customize a given implementation see the following documentation:

* link:../../../../spring-cloud-circuitbreaker/reference/spring-cloud-circuitbreaker-resilience4j.html[Resilience4J]
* link:https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/blob/master/spring-cloud-alibaba-docs/src/main/asciidoc/circuitbreaker-sentinel.adoc#circuit-breaker-spring-cloud-circuit-breaker-with-sentinel--configuring-sentinel-circuit-breakers[Sentinel]
* link:../../../../../spring-cloud-circuitbreaker/reference/spring-cloud-circuitbreaker-spring-retry.html[Spring Retry]

Some `CircuitBreaker` implementations such as `Resilience4JCircuitBreaker` call `customize` method every time `CircuitBreaker#run` is called.
It can be inefficient.
In that case, you can use `CircuitBreaker#once` method.
It is useful where calling `customize` many times doesn't make sense, for example, in case of https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/circuitbreaker#section-consume-emitted-circuitbreakerevents[consuming Resilience4j's events].

The following example shows the way for each `io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreaker` to consume events.

[source,java]
----
Customizer.once(circuitBreaker -> {
  circuitBreaker.getEventPublisher()
    .onStateTransition(event -> log.info("{}: {}", event.getCircuitBreakerName(), event.getStateTransition()));
}, CircuitBreaker::getName)
----

[[service-clients]]
== Spring HTTP Service Clients Support

Spring Cloud provides support for Spring HTTP Service Clients integration through the following configurers:

- `CircuitBreakerRestClientHttpServiceGroupConfigurer`
- `CircuitBreakerWebClientHttpServiceGroupConfigurer`

These configurers enable CircuitBreaker support for https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/7.0-SNAPSHOT/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-http-service-client-group-config[Spring HTTP Service Client Groups].

When fallback classes are configured using the `@HttpServiceFallbackAnnotation`,
CircuitBreaker adapter decorators are added:
- `CircuitBreakerAdapterDecorator` is used with `RestClient`
- `ReactiveCircuitBreakerAdapterDecorator` is used with `WebClient`

[NOTE]
====
You can disable CircuitBreaker integration for HTTP service clients by setting the appropriate property:

- For blocking (`RestClient`) clients: `spring.cloud.circuitbreaker.http-services.enabled=false`
- For reactive (`WebClient`) clients: `spring.cloud.circuitbreaker.reactive-http-services.enabled=false`

This prevents CircuitBreaker decorators from being applied to interface-based HTTP client groups.
====

=== Declaring Fallbacks with Annotations

Fallbacks are configured using the `@HttpServiceFallback` annotation on configuration classes.
This annotation allows you to declare:

- The fallback implementation class (via `value`)
- The service interfaces the fallback supports (via `forService`, optional)
- The group the fallback applies to (via `forGroup`, optional)

Multiple `@HttpServiceFallback` annotations can be declared on the same class using Java’s `@Repeatable` annotation mechanism.
If no group is specified, the fallback applies to all groups that do not have an explicit per-group fallback for the given service interfaces.

Fallback classes are resolved using the following precedence:

. A fallback class with both matching `forService` and `forGroup`
. A fallback class with matching `forService` and no `forGroup` (global fallback for service)
. A fallback class with no `forService` or `forGroup` (default for all services in group or globally)

==== Example

[source,java]
----
@HttpServiceFallback(value = DefaultFallbacks.class)
@HttpServiceFallback(value = GroupAndServiceSpecificFallbacks.class, service = {BillingService.class, ShippingService.class}, group = "billing")
public class MyFallbackConfig {
    ...
}
----

This configuration results in:

- `DefaultFallbacks` used as a global fallback for all services not explicitly handled
- `GroupAndServiceSpecificFallbacks` used only for `BillingService` and `ShippingService` within the `"billing"` group

[NOTE]
====
- The fallback class and its methods must be `public`
- Fallback methods must not be annotated with `@HttpExchange` annotations
====

=== How CircuitBreaker Adapters Work

The adapters wrap `@HttpExchange` method calls with CircuitBreaker logic.
When a fallback is triggered, a proxy is created using the user-defined fallback class.
The appropriate fallback method is selected by matching:

- A method with the same name and parameter types, or
- A method with the same name and parameter types preceded by a `Throwable` argument (to access the cause of failure)

Given the following interface:

[source,java]
----
@HttpExchange("/test")
public interface TestService {

    @GetExchange("/{id}")
    Person test(@PathVariable UUID id);

    @GetExchange
    String test();
}
----

A matching fallback class could be:

[source,java]
----
public class TestServiceFallback {

    public Person test(UUID id);

    public String test(Throwable cause);
}
----
