If you get an exception due to "Illegal key size" and you use Sun's JDK, you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.
See the following links for more information:

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html[Java 8 JCE]

Extract the files into the JDK/jre/lib/security folder for whichever version of JRE/JDK x64/x86 you use.
