== Spring Cloud Context: Application Context Services

Spring Boot has an opinionated view of how to build an application with Spring.
For instance, it has conventional locations for common configuration files and has endpoints for common management and monitoring tasks.
Spring Cloud builds on top of that and adds a few features that many components in a system would use or occasionally need.

=== The Bootstrap Application Context

A Spring Cloud application operates by creating a "`bootstrap`" context, which is a parent context for the main application.
This context is responsible for loading configuration properties from the external sources and for decrypting properties in the local external configuration files.
The two contexts share an `Environment`, which is the source of external properties for any Spring application.
By default, bootstrap properties (not `bootstrap.properties` but properties that are loaded during the bootstrap phase) are added with high precedence, so they cannot be overridden by local configuration.

The bootstrap context uses a different convention for locating external configuration than the main application context.
Instead of `application.yml` (or `.properties`), you can use `bootstrap.yml`, keeping the external configuration for bootstrap and main context nicely separate.
The following listing shows an example:

.bootstrap.yml
====
----
spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: ${SPRING_CONFIG_URI:http://localhost:8888}
----
====

If your application needs any application-specific configuration from the server, it is a good idea to set the `spring.application.name` (in `bootstrap.yml` or `application.yml`).
For the property `spring.application.name` to be used as the application's context ID, you must set it in `bootstrap.[properties | yml]`.

If you want to retrieve specific profile configuration, you should also set `spring.profiles.active` in `bootstrap.[properties | yml]`.

You can disable the bootstrap process completely by setting `spring.cloud.bootstrap.enabled=false` (for example, in system properties).

=== Application Context Hierarchies

If you build an application context from `SpringApplication` or `SpringApplicationBuilder`, the Bootstrap context is added as a parent to that context.
It is a feature of Spring that child contexts inherit property sources and profiles from their parent, so the "`main`" application context contains additional property sources, compared to building the same context without Spring Cloud Config.
The additional property sources are:

* "`bootstrap`": If any `PropertySourceLocators` are found in the bootstrap context and if they have non-empty properties, an optional `CompositePropertySource` appears with high priority.
An example would be properties from the Spring Cloud Config Server.
See "`<<customizing-bootstrap-property-sources>>`" for how to customize the contents of this property source.

* "`applicationConfig: [classpath:bootstrap.yml]`" (and related files if Spring profiles are active): If you have a `bootstrap.yml` (or `.properties`), those properties are used to configure the bootstrap context.
Then they get added to the child context when its parent is set.
They have lower precedence than the `application.yml` (or `.properties`) and any other property sources that are added to the child as a normal part of the process of creating a Spring Boot application.
See "`<<customizing-bootstrap-properties>>`" for how to customize the contents of these property sources.

Because of the ordering rules of property sources, the "`bootstrap`" entries take precedence.
However, note that these do not contain any data from `bootstrap.yml`, which has very low precedence but can be used to set defaults.

You can extend the context hierarchy by setting the parent context of any `ApplicationContext` you create -- for example, by using its own interface or with the `SpringApplicationBuilder` convenience methods (`parent()`, `child()` and `sibling()`).
The bootstrap context is the parent of the most senior ancestor that you create yourself.
Every context in the hierarchy has its own "`bootstrap`" (possibly empty) property source to avoid promoting values inadvertently from parents down to their descendants.
If there is a config server, every context in the hierarchy can also (in principle) have a different `spring.application.name` and, hence, a different remote property source.
Normal Spring application context behavior rules apply to property resolution: properties from a child context override those in
the parent, by name and also by property source name.
(If the child has a property source with the same name as the parent, the value from the parent is not included in the child).

Note that the `SpringApplicationBuilder` lets you share an `Environment` amongst the whole hierarchy, but that is not the default.
Thus, sibling contexts (in particular) do not need to have the same profiles or property sources, even though they may share common values with their parent.

[[customizing-bootstrap-properties]]
=== Changing the Location of Bootstrap Properties

The `bootstrap.yml` (or `.properties`) location can be specified by setting `spring.cloud.bootstrap.name` (default: `bootstrap`), `spring.cloud.bootstrap.location` (default: empty) or `spring.cloud.bootstrap.additional-location` (default: empty) -- for example, in System properties.

Those properties behave like the `spring.config.*` variants with the same name.
With `spring.cloud.bootstrap.location` the default locations are replaced and only the specified ones are used.
To add locations to the list of default ones, `spring.cloud.bootstrap.additional-location` could be used.
In fact, they are used to set up the bootstrap `ApplicationContext` by setting those properties in its `Environment`.
If there is an active profile (from `spring.profiles.active` or through the `Environment` API in the context you are building), properties in that profile get loaded as well, the same as in a regular Spring Boot app -- for example, from `bootstrap-development.properties` for a `development` profile.

[[overriding-bootstrap-properties]]
=== Overriding the Values of Remote Properties

The property sources that are added to your application by the bootstrap context are often "`remote`" (from example, from Spring Cloud Config Server).
By default, they cannot be overridden locally.
If you want to let your applications override the remote properties with their own system properties or config files, the remote property source has to grant it permission by setting `spring.cloud.config.allowOverride=true` (it does not work to set this locally).
Once that flag is set, two finer-grained settings control the location of the remote properties in relation to system properties and the application's local configuration:

* `spring.cloud.config.overrideNone=true`: Override from any local property source.
* `spring.cloud.config.overrideSystemProperties=false`: Only system properties, command line arguments, and environment variables (but not the local config files) should override the remote settings.

=== Customizing the Bootstrap Configuration

The bootstrap context can be set to do anything you like by adding entries to `/META-INF/spring.factories` under a key named `org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration`.
This holds a comma-separated list of Spring `@Configuration` classes that are used to create the context.
Any beans that you want to be available to the main application context for autowiring can be created here.
There is a special contract for `@Beans` of type `ApplicationContextInitializer`.
If you want to control the startup sequence, you can mark classes with the `@Order` annotation (the default order is `last`).

WARNING: When adding custom `BootstrapConfiguration`, be careful that the classes you add are not `@ComponentScanned` by mistake into your "`main`" application context, where they might not be needed.
Use a separate package name for boot configuration classes and make sure that name is not already covered by your `@ComponentScan` or `@SpringBootApplication` annotated configuration classes.

The bootstrap process ends by injecting initializers into the main `SpringApplication` instance (which is the normal Spring Boot startup sequence, whether it runs as a standalone application or is deployed in an application server).
First, a bootstrap context is created from the classes found in `spring.factories`.
Then, all `@Beans` of type `ApplicationContextInitializer` are added to the main `SpringApplication` before it is started.

[[customizing-bootstrap-property-sources]]
=== Customizing the Bootstrap Property Sources

The default property source for external configuration added by the bootstrap process is the Spring Cloud Config Server, but you can add additional sources by adding beans of type `PropertySourceLocator` to the bootstrap context (through `spring.factories`).
For instance, you can insert additional properties from a different server or from a database.

As an example, consider the following custom locator:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class CustomPropertySourceLocator implements PropertySourceLocator {

    @Override
    public PropertySource<?> locate(Environment environment) {
        return new MapPropertySource("customProperty",
                Collections.<String, Object>singletonMap("property.from.sample.custom.source", "worked as intended"));
    }

}
----
====

The `Environment` that is passed in is the one for the `ApplicationContext` about to be created -- in other words, the one for which we supply additional property sources.
It already has its normal Spring Boot-provided property sources, so you can use those to locate a property source specific to this `Environment` (for example, by keying it on `spring.application.name`, as is done in the default Spring Cloud Config Server property source locator).

If you create a jar with this class in it and then add a `META-INF/spring.factories` containing the following setting, the `customProperty` `PropertySource` appears in any application that includes that jar on its classpath:

====
[source]
----
org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration=sample.custom.CustomPropertySourceLocator
----
====

=== Logging Configuration

If you use Spring Boot to configure log settings, you should place this configuration in `bootstrap.[yml | properties]` if you would like it to apply to all events.

NOTE: For Spring Cloud to initialize logging configuration properly, you cannot use a custom prefix.
For example, using `custom.loggin.logpath` is not recognized by Spring Cloud when initializing the logging system.

=== Environment Changes

The application listens for an `EnvironmentChangeEvent` and reacts to the change in a couple of standard ways (additional `ApplicationListeners` can be added as `@Beans` in the normal way).
When an `EnvironmentChangeEvent` is observed, it has a list of key values that have changed, and the application uses those to:

* Re-bind any `@ConfigurationProperties` beans in the context.
* Set the logger levels for any properties in `logging.level.*`.

Note that the Spring Cloud Config Client does not, by default, poll for changes in the `Environment`.
Generally, we would not recommend that approach for detecting changes (although you could set it up with a
`@Scheduled` annotation).
If you have a scaled-out client application, it is better to broadcast the `EnvironmentChangeEvent` to all the instances instead of having them polling for changes (for example, by using the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus[Spring Cloud Bus]).

The `EnvironmentChangeEvent` covers a large class of refresh use cases, as long as you can actually make a change to the `Environment` and publish the event.
Note that those APIs are public and part of core Spring).
You can verify that the changes are bound to `@ConfigurationProperties` beans by visiting the `/configprops` endpoint (a standard Spring Boot Actuator feature).
For instance, a `DataSource` can have its `maxPoolSize` changed at runtime (the default `DataSource` created by Spring Boot is a `@ConfigurationProperties` bean) and grow capacity dynamically.
Re-binding `@ConfigurationProperties` does not cover another large class of use cases, where you need more control over the refresh and where you need a change to be atomic over the whole `ApplicationContext`.
To address those concerns, we have `@RefreshScope`.

[[refresh-scope]]
=== Refresh Scope

When there is a configuration change, a Spring `@Bean` that is marked as `@RefreshScope` gets special treatment.
This feature addresses the problem of stateful beans that get their configuration injected only when they are initialized.
For instance, if a `DataSource` has open connections when the database URL is changed through the `Environment`, you probably want the holders of those connections to be able to complete what they are doing.
Then, the next time something borrows a connection from the pool, it gets one with the new URL.

Sometimes, it might even be mandatory to apply the `@RefreshScope` annotation on some beans that can be only initialized once.
If a bean is "`immutable`", you have to either annotate the bean with `@RefreshScope` or specify the classname under the property key: `spring.cloud.refresh.extra-refreshable`.

WARNING: If you hava a `DataSource` bean that is a `HikariDataSource`, it can not be
refreshed. It is the default value for `spring.cloud.refresh.never-refreshable`. Choose a
different `DataSource` implementation if you need it to be refreshed.

Refresh scope beans are lazy proxies that initialize when they are used (that is, when a method is called), and the scope acts as a cache of initialized values.
To force a bean to re-initialize on the next method call, you must invalidate its cache entry.

The `RefreshScope` is a bean in the context and has a public `refreshAll()` method to refresh all beans in the scope by clearing the target cache.
The `/refresh` endpoint exposes this functionality (over HTTP or JMX).
To refresh an individual bean by name, there is also a `refresh(String)` method.

To expose the `/refresh` endpoint, you need to add following configuration to your application:

====
[source,yaml]
----
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: refresh
----
====

NOTE: `@RefreshScope` works (technically) on a `@Configuration` class, but it might lead to surprising behavior.
For example, it does not mean that all the `@Beans` defined in that class are themselves in `@RefreshScope`.
Specifically, anything that depends on those beans cannot rely on them being updated when a refresh is initiated, unless it is itself in `@RefreshScope`.
In that case, it is rebuilt on a refresh and its dependencies are re-injected.
At that point, they are re-initialized from the refreshed `@Configuration`).

=== Encryption and Decryption

Spring Cloud has an `Environment` pre-processor for decrypting property values locally.
It follows the same rules as the Spring Cloud Config Server and has the same external configuration through `encrypt.\*`.
Thus, you can use encrypted values in the form of `{cipher}*`, and, as long as there is a valid key, they are decrypted before the main application context gets the `Environment` settings.
To use the encryption features in an application, you need to include Spring Security RSA in your classpath (Maven co-ordinates: `org.springframework.security:spring-security-rsa`), and you also need the full strength JCE extensions in your JVM.

include::jce.adoc[]

=== Endpoints

For a Spring Boot Actuator application, some additional management endpoints are available. You can use:

* `POST` to `/actuator/env` to update the `Environment` and rebind `@ConfigurationProperties` and log levels.
* `/actuator/refresh` to re-load the boot strap context and refresh the `@RefreshScope` beans.
* `/actuator/restart` to close the `ApplicationContext` and restart it (disabled by default).
* `/actuator/pause` and `/actuator/resume` for calling the `Lifecycle` methods (`stop()` and `start()` on the `ApplicationContext`).

NOTE: If you disable the `/actuator/restart` endpoint then the `/actuator/pause` and `/actuator/resume` endpoints
will also be disabled since they are just a special case of `/actuator/restart`.

== Spring Cloud Commons: Common Abstractions

Patterns such as service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breakers lend themselves to a common abstraction layer that can be consumed by all Spring Cloud clients, independent of the implementation (for example, discovery with Eureka or Consul).

[[discovery-client]]
=== The `@EnableDiscoveryClient` Annotation

Spring Cloud Commons provides the `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation.
This looks for implementations of the `DiscoveryClient` and `ReactiveDiscoveryClient` interfaces with `META-INF/spring.factories`.
Implementations of the discovery client add a configuration class to `spring.factories` under the `org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient` key.
Examples of `DiscoveryClient` implementations include https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/[Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka], https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-consul/[Spring Cloud Consul Discovery], and https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-zookeeper/[Spring Cloud Zookeeper Discovery].

Spring Cloud will provide both the blocking and reactive service discovery clients by default.
You can disable the blocking and/or reactive clients easily by setting `spring.cloud.discovery.blocking.enabled=false` or `spring.cloud.discovery.reactive.enabled=false`.
To completely disable service discovery you just need to set `spring.cloud.discovery.enabled=false`.

By default, implementations of `DiscoveryClient` auto-register the local Spring Boot server with the remote discovery server.
This behavior can be disabled by setting `autoRegister=false` in `@EnableDiscoveryClient`.

NOTE: `@EnableDiscoveryClient` is no longer required.
You can put a `DiscoveryClient` implementation on the classpath to cause the Spring Boot application to register with the service discovery server.

==== Health Indicator

Commons creates a Spring Boot `HealthIndicator` that `DiscoveryClient` implementations can participate in by implementing `DiscoveryHealthIndicator`.
To disable the composite `HealthIndicator`, set `spring.cloud.discovery.client.composite-indicator.enabled=false`.
A generic `HealthIndicator` based on `DiscoveryClient` is auto-configured (`DiscoveryClientHealthIndicator`).
To disable it, set `spring.cloud.discovery.client.health-indicator.enabled=false`.
To disable the description field of the `DiscoveryClientHealthIndicator`, set `spring.cloud.discovery.client.health-indicator.include-description=false`.
Otherwise, it can bubble up as the `description` of the rolled up `HealthIndicator`.

==== Ordering `DiscoveryClient` instances
`DiscoveryClient` interface extends `Ordered`. This is useful when using multiple discovery
 clients, as it allows you to define the order of the returned discovery clients, similar to
how you can order the beans loaded by a Spring application. By default, the order of any `DiscoveryClient` is set to
`0`. If you want to set a different order for your custom `DiscoveryClient` implementations, you just need to override
the `getOrder()` method so that it returns the value that is suitable for your setup. Apart from this, you can use
properties to set the order of the `DiscoveryClient`
implementations provided by Spring Cloud, among others  `ConsulDiscoveryClient`, `EurekaDiscoveryClient` and
`ZookeeperDiscoveryClient`. In order to do it, you just need to set the
`spring.cloud.{clientIdentifier}.discovery.order` (or `eureka.client.order` for Eureka) property to the desired value.

==== SimpleDiscoveryClient

If there is no Service-Registry-backed `DiscoveryClient` in the classpath, `SimpleDiscoveryClient`
instance, that uses properties to get information on service and instances, will be used.

The information about the available instances should be passed to via properties in the following format:
`spring.cloud.discovery.client.simple.instances.service1[0].uri=http://s11:8080`, where
`spring.cloud.discovery.client.simple.instances` is the common prefix, then `service1` stands
for the ID of the service in question, while `[0]` indicates the index number of the instance
(as visible in the example, indexes start with `0`), and then the value of `uri` is
the actual URI under which the instance is available.

=== ServiceRegistry

Commons now provides a `ServiceRegistry` interface that provides methods such as `register(Registration)` and `deregister(Registration)`, which let you provide custom registered services.
`Registration` is a marker interface.

The following example shows the `ServiceRegistry` in use:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
@EnableDiscoveryClient(autoRegister=false)
public class MyConfiguration {
    private ServiceRegistry registry;

    public MyConfiguration(ServiceRegistry registry) {
        this.registry = registry;
    }

    // called through some external process, such as an event or a custom actuator endpoint
    public void register() {
        Registration registration = constructRegistration();
        this.registry.register(registration);
    }
}
----
====

Each `ServiceRegistry` implementation has its own `Registry` implementation.

* `ZookeeperRegistration` used with `ZookeeperServiceRegistry`
* `EurekaRegistration` used with `EurekaServiceRegistry`
* `ConsulRegistration` used with `ConsulServiceRegistry`

If you are using the `ServiceRegistry` interface, you are going to need to pass the
correct `Registry` implementation for the `ServiceRegistry` implementation you
are using.


==== ServiceRegistry Auto-Registration

By default, the `ServiceRegistry` implementation auto-registers the running service.
To disable that behavior, you can set:
* `@EnableDiscoveryClient(autoRegister=false)` to permanently disable auto-registration.
* `spring.cloud.service-registry.auto-registration.enabled=false` to disable the behavior through configuration.

===== ServiceRegistry Auto-Registration Events

There are two events that will be fired when a service auto-registers.  The first event, called
`InstancePreRegisteredEvent`, is fired before the service is registered.  The second
event, called `InstanceRegisteredEvent`, is fired after the service is registered.  You can register an
`ApplicationListener`(s) to listen to and react to these events.

NOTE: These events will not be fired if the `spring.cloud.service-registry.auto-registration.enabled` property is set to `false`.

==== Service Registry Actuator Endpoint

Spring Cloud Commons provides a `/service-registry` actuator endpoint.
This endpoint relies on a `Registration` bean in the Spring Application Context.
Calling `/service-registry` with GET returns the status of the `Registration`.
Using POST to the same endpoint with a JSON body changes the status of the current `Registration` to the new value.
The JSON body has to include the `status` field with the preferred value.
Please see the documentation of the `ServiceRegistry` implementation you use for the allowed values when updating the status and the values returned for the status.
For instance, Eureka's supported statuses are `UP`, `DOWN`, `OUT_OF_SERVICE`, and `UNKNOWN`.

[[rest-template-loadbalancer-client]]
=== Spring RestTemplate as a Load Balancer Client

You can configure a `RestTemplate` to use a Load-balancer client.
To create a load-balanced `RestTemplate`, create a `RestTemplate` `@Bean` and use the `@LoadBalanced` qualifier, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @LoadBalanced
    @Bean
    RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}

public class MyClass {
    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public String doOtherStuff() {
        String results = restTemplate.getForObject("http://stores/stores", String.class);
        return results;
    }
}
----
====

CAUTION: A `RestTemplate` bean is no longer created through auto-configuration.
Individual applications must create it.

The URI needs to use a virtual host name (that is, a service name, not a host name).
The Ribbon client is used to create a full physical address.
See {githubroot}/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/spring-cloud-netflix-ribbon/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/ribbon/RibbonAutoConfiguration.java[`RibbonAutoConfiguration`] for the details of how the `RestTemplate` is set up.

IMPORTANT: To use a load-balanced `RestTemplate`, you need to have a load-balancer implementation in your classpath.
The recommended implementation is `BlockingLoadBalancerClient`.
Add <<spring-cloud-loadbalancer-starter, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer starter>> to your project in order to use it.
The
`RibbonLoadBalancerClient` also can be used, but it's now under maintenance and we do not recommend adding it to new projects.

WARNING:  By default, if you have both `RibbonLoadBalancerClient` and `BlockingLoadBalancerClient`, to
preserve backward compatibility, `RibbonLoadBalancerClient` is used.
To override it, you can set the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.ribbon.enabled` property to `false`.

[[webclinet-loadbalancer-client]]
=== Spring WebClient as a Load Balancer Client

You can configure `WebClient` to automatically use a load-balancer client.
To create a load-balanced `WebClient`, create a `WebClient.Builder` `@Bean` and use the `@LoadBalanced` qualifier, as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

	@Bean
	@LoadBalanced
	public WebClient.Builder loadBalancedWebClientBuilder() {
		return WebClient.builder();
	}
}

public class MyClass {
    @Autowired
    private WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder;

    public Mono<String> doOtherStuff() {
        return webClientBuilder.build().get().uri("http://stores/stores")
        				.retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class);
    }
}
----
====

The URI needs to use a virtual host name (that is, a service name, not a host name).
The Ribbon client or Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is used to create a full physical address.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use a `@LoadBalanced WebClient.Builder`, you need to have a load balancer
implementation in the classpath. We recommend that you add the
<<spring-cloud-loadbalancer-starter, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer starter>> to your project.
Then, `ReactiveLoadBalancer` is used underneath.
Alternatively, this functionality also works with `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon`, but the request
is handled by a non-reactive `LoadBalancerClient` under the hood. Additionally,
`spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon` is already in maintenance mode, so we do not recommend
adding it to new projects.
If you have both `spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer` and `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon`
in your classpath, Ribbon is used by default. To switch to Spring Cloud LoadBalancer,
set the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.ribbon.enabled` property to `false`.

==== Retrying Failed Requests

A load-balanced `RestTemplate` can be configured to retry failed requests.
By default, this logic is disabled.
You can enable it by adding link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] to your application's classpath.

If you would like to disable the retry logic with Spring Retry on the classpath, you can set `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.enabled=false`.

If you would like to implement a `BackOffPolicy` in your retries, you need to create a bean of type `LoadBalancedRetryFactory` and override the `createBackOffPolicy()` method.

===== Ribbon-based retries

For the Ribbon-backed implementation, the load-balanced `RestTemplate` honors some of the Ribbon configuration values related to retrying failed requests.
You can use the `client.ribbon.MaxAutoRetries`, `client.ribbon.MaxAutoRetriesNextServer`, and `client.ribbon.OkToRetryOnAllOperations` properties.

See the https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/wiki/Getting-Started#the-properties-file-sample-clientproperties[Ribbon documentation] for a description of what these properties do.

===== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer-based retries

For the Spring Cloud LoadBalancer-backed implementation, you can set:

- `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.maxRetriesOnSameServiceInstance` - indicates how many times a request should be retried on the same `ServiceInstance` (counted separately for every selected instance)
- `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.maxRetriesOnNextServiceInstance` - indicates how many times a request should be retried a newly selected `ServiceInstance`
- `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.retryableStatusCodes` - the status codes on which to always retry a failed request.

WARN:: If you chose to override the `LoadBalancedRetryFactory` while using the Spring Cloud LoadBalancer-backed approach, make sure you annotate your bean with `@Order` and set it to a higher precedence than `1000`, which is the order set on the `BlockingLoadBalancedRetryFactory`.

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean
    LoadBalancedRetryFactory retryFactory() {
        return new LoadBalancedRetryFactory() {
            @Override
            public BackOffPolicy createBackOffPolicy(String service) {
        		return new ExponentialBackOffPolicy();
        	}
        };
    }
}
----
====

NOTE: `client` in the preceding examples should be replaced with your Ribbon client's name.

If you want to add one or more `RetryListener` implementations to your retry functionality, you need to
create a bean of type `LoadBalancedRetryListenerFactory` and return the `RetryListener` array
you would like to use for a given service, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean
    LoadBalancedRetryListenerFactory retryListenerFactory() {
        return new LoadBalancedRetryListenerFactory() {
            @Override
            public RetryListener[] createRetryListeners(String service) {
                return new RetryListener[]{new RetryListener() {
                    @Override
                    public <T, E extends Throwable> boolean open(RetryContext context, RetryCallback<T, E> callback) {
                        //TODO Do you business...
                        return true;
                    }

                    @Override
                     public <T, E extends Throwable> void close(RetryContext context, RetryCallback<T, E> callback, Throwable throwable) {
                        //TODO Do you business...
                    }

                    @Override
                    public <T, E extends Throwable> void onError(RetryContext context, RetryCallback<T, E> callback, Throwable throwable) {
                        //TODO Do you business...
                    }
                }};
            }
        };
    }
}
----
====

=== Multiple `RestTemplate` Objects

If you want a `RestTemplate` that is not load-balanced, create a `RestTemplate` bean and inject it.
To access the load-balanced `RestTemplate`, use the `@LoadBalanced` qualifier when you create your `@Bean`, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @LoadBalanced
    @Bean
    RestTemplate loadBalanced() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean
    RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}

public class MyClass {
@Autowired
private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Autowired
    @LoadBalanced
    private RestTemplate loadBalanced;

    public String doOtherStuff() {
        return loadBalanced.getForObject("http://stores/stores", String.class);
    }

    public String doStuff() {
        return restTemplate.getForObject("http://example.com", String.class);
    }
}
----
====

IMPORTANT: Notice the use of the `@Primary` annotation on the plain `RestTemplate` declaration in the preceding example to disambiguate the unqualified `@Autowired` injection.

TIP: If you see errors such as `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Can not set org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate field com.my.app.Foo.restTemplate to com.sun.proxy.$Proxy89`, try injecting `RestOperations` or setting `spring.aop.proxyTargetClass=true`.

=== Multiple WebClient Objects

If you want a `WebClient` that is not load-balanced, create a `WebClient` bean and inject it.
To access the load-balanced `WebClient`, use the `@LoadBalanced` qualifier when you create your `@Bean`, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @LoadBalanced
    @Bean
    WebClient.Builder loadBalanced() {
        return WebClient.builder();
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean
    WebClient.Builder webClient() {
        return WebClient.builder();
    }
}

public class MyClass {
    @Autowired
    private WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder;

    @Autowired
    @LoadBalanced
    private WebClient.Builder loadBalanced;

    public Mono<String> doOtherStuff() {
        return loadBalanced.build().get().uri("http://stores/stores")
        				.retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class);
    }

    public Mono<String> doStuff() {
        return webClientBuilder.build().get().uri("http://example.com")
        				.retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class);
    }
}
----

[[loadbalanced-webclient]]
=== Spring WebFlux `WebClient` as a Load Balancer Client

The Spring WebFlux can work with both reactive and non-reactive `WebClient` configurations, as the topics describe:

* <<webflux-with-reactive-loadbalancer>>
* <<load-balancer-exchange-filter-functionload-balancer-exchange-filter-function>>

[[webflux-with-reactive-loadbalancer]]
==== Spring WebFlux `WebClient` with `ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction`

You can configure `WebClient` to use the `ReactiveLoadBalancer`.
If you add <<spring-cloud-loadbalancer-starter, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer starter>> to your project
and if `spring-webflux` is on the classpath, `ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction` is auto-configured.
The following example shows how to configure a `WebClient` to use reactive load-balancer:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class MyClass {
    @Autowired
    private ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction lbFunction;

    public Mono<String> doOtherStuff() {
        return WebClient.builder().baseUrl("http://stores")
            .filter(lbFunction)
            .build()
            .get()
            .uri("/stores")
            .retrieve()
            .bodyToMono(String.class);
    }
}
----
====

The URI needs to use a virtual host name (that is, a service name, not a host name).
The `ReactorLoadBalancer` is used to create a full physical address.

NOTE: By default, if you have `spring-cloud-netflix-ribbon` in your classpath, <<load-balancer-exchange-filter-function,`LoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction`>>
is used to maintain backward compatibility. To use
`ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction`, set the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.ribbon.enabled` property
to `false`.

[[load-balancer-exchange-filter-function]]
==== Spring WebFlux `WebClient` with a Non-reactive Load Balancer Client

If you you do not have <<spring-cloud-loadbalancer-starter, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer starter>> in your project
but you do have spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon, you can still use `WebClient` with `LoadBalancerClient`.
If `spring-webflux` is on the classpath, `LoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction`
is auto-configured. Note, however, that this
uses a non-reactive client under the hood.
The following example shows how to configure a `WebClient` to use load-balancer:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class MyClass {
    @Autowired
    private LoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction lbFunction;

    public Mono<String> doOtherStuff() {
        return WebClient.builder().baseUrl("http://stores")
            .filter(lbFunction)
            .build()
            .get()
            .uri("/stores")
            .retrieve()
            .bodyToMono(String.class);
    }
}
----
====

The URI needs to use a virtual host name (that is, a service name, not a host name).
The `LoadBalancerClient` is used to create a full physical address.

WARN: This approach is now deprecated.
We suggest that you use <<webflux-with-reactive-loadbalancer,WebFlux with reactive Load-Balancer>>
instead.

[[ignore-network-interfaces]]
=== Ignore Network Interfaces

Sometimes, it is useful to ignore certain named network interfaces so that they can be excluded from Service Discovery registration (for example, when running in a Docker container).
A list of regular expressions can be set to cause the desired network interfaces to be ignored.
The following configuration ignores the `docker0` interface and all interfaces that start with `veth`:

.application.yml
====
----
spring:
  cloud:
    inetutils:
      ignoredInterfaces:
        - docker0
        - veth.*
----
====

You can also force the use of only specified network addresses by using a list of regular expressions, as the following example shows:

.bootstrap.yml
====
----
spring:
  cloud:
    inetutils:
      preferredNetworks:
        - 192.168
        - 10.0
----
====

You can also force the use of only site-local addresses, as the following example shows:

.application.yml
====
----
spring:
  cloud:
    inetutils:
      useOnlySiteLocalInterfaces: true
----
====

See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/Inet4Address.html#isSiteLocalAddress--[Inet4Address.html.isSiteLocalAddress()] for more details about what constitutes a site-local address.

[[http-clients]]
=== HTTP Client Factories

Spring Cloud Commons provides beans for creating both Apache HTTP clients (`ApacheHttpClientFactory`) and OK HTTP clients (`OkHttpClientFactory`).
The `OkHttpClientFactory` bean is created only if the OK HTTP jar is on the classpath.
In addition, Spring Cloud Commons provides beans for creating the connection managers used by both clients: `ApacheHttpClientConnectionManagerFactory` for the Apache HTTP client and `OkHttpClientConnectionPoolFactory` for the OK HTTP client.
If you would like to customize how the HTTP clients are created in downstream projects, you can provide your own implementation of these beans.
In addition, if you provide a bean of type `HttpClientBuilder` or `OkHttpClient.Builder`, the default factories use these builders as the basis for the builders returned to downstream projects.
You can also disable the creation of these beans by setting `spring.cloud.httpclientfactories.apache.enabled` or `spring.cloud.httpclientfactories.ok.enabled` to `false`.

[[enabled-features]]
=== Enabled Features

Spring Cloud Commons provides a `/features` actuator endpoint.
This endpoint returns features available on the classpath and whether they are enabled.
The information returned includes the feature type, name, version, and vendor.

==== Feature types

There are two types of 'features': abstract and named.

Abstract features are features where an interface or abstract class is defined and that an implementation the creates, such as `DiscoveryClient`, `LoadBalancerClient`, or `LockService`.
The abstract class or interface is used to find a bean of that type in the context.
The version displayed is `bean.getClass().getPackage().getImplementationVersion()`.

Named features are features that do not have a particular class they implement. These features include "`Circuit Breaker`", "`API Gateway`", "`Spring Cloud Bus`", and others. These features require a name and a bean type.

==== Declaring features

Any module can declare any number of `HasFeature` beans, as the following examples show:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Bean
public HasFeatures commonsFeatures() {
  return HasFeatures.abstractFeatures(DiscoveryClient.class, LoadBalancerClient.class);
}

@Bean
public HasFeatures consulFeatures() {
  return HasFeatures.namedFeatures(
    new NamedFeature("Spring Cloud Bus", ConsulBusAutoConfiguration.class),
    new NamedFeature("Circuit Breaker", HystrixCommandAspect.class));
}

@Bean
HasFeatures localFeatures() {
  return HasFeatures.builder()
      .abstractFeature(Something.class)
      .namedFeature(new NamedFeature("Some Other Feature", Someother.class))
      .abstractFeature(Somethingelse.class)
      .build();
}
----
====

Each of these beans should go in an appropriately guarded `@Configuration`.


=== Spring Cloud Compatibility Verification

Due to the fact that some users have problem with setting up Spring Cloud application, we've decided
to add a compatibility verification mechanism. It will break if your current setup is not compatible
with Spring Cloud requirements, together with a report, showing what exactly went wrong.

At the moment we verify which version of Spring Boot is added to your classpath.

Example of a report

====
----
***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

Your project setup is incompatible with our requirements due to following reasons:

- Spring Boot [2.1.0.RELEASE] is not compatible with this Spring Cloud release train


Action:

Consider applying the following actions:

- Change Spring Boot version to one of the following versions [1.2.x, 1.3.x] .
You can find the latest Spring Boot versions here [https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#learn].
If you want to learn more about the Spring Cloud Release train compatibility, you can visit this page [https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud#overview] and check the [Release Trains] section.
----
====

In order to disable this feature, set `spring.cloud.compatibility-verifier.enabled` to `false`.
If you want to override the compatible Spring Boot versions, just set the
`spring.cloud.compatibility-verifier.compatible-boot-versions` property with a comma separated list
of compatible Spring Boot versions.

== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

Spring Cloud provides its own client-side load-balancer abstraction and implementation. For the load-balancing
mechanism, `ReactiveLoadBalancer` interface has been added and a Round-Robin-based implementation
has been provided for it. In order to get instances to select from reactive `ServiceInstanceListSupplier`
is used. Currently we support a service-discovery-based implementation of `ServiceInstanceListSupplier`
that retrieves available instances from Service Discovery using a <<discovery-client, Discovery Client>> available in the classpath.

=== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer integrations

In order to make it easy to use Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, we provide `ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction` that can be used with `WebClient` and `BlockingLoadBalancerClient` that works with `RestTemplate`.
You can see more information and examples of usage in the following sections:

* <<rest-template-loadbalancer-client,Spring RestTemplate as a Load Balancer Client>>
* <<webclinet-loadbalancer-client, Spring WebClient as a Load Balancer Client>>
* <<webflux-with-reactive-loadbalancer,Spring WebFlux WebClient with `ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction`>>

[[loadbalancer-caching]]
=== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer Caching

Apart from the basic `ServiceInstanceListSupplier` implementation that retrieves instances via `DiscoveryClient` each time it has to choose an instance, we provide two caching implementations.

==== https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[Caffeine]-backed LoadBalancer Cache Implementation

If you have `com.github.ben-manes.caffeine:caffeine` in the classpath, Caffeine-based implementation will be used.
See the <<loadbalancer-cache-configuration, LoadBalancerCacheConfiguration>> section for information on how to configure it.

If you are using Caffeine, you can also override the default Caffeine Cache setup for the LoadBalancer by passing your own https://static.javadoc.io/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/2.2.2/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/CaffeineSpec.html[Caffeine Specification]
in the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.cache.caffeine.spec` property.

WARN: Passing your own Caffeine specification will override any other LoadBalancerCache settings, including <<loadbalancer-cache-configuration, General LoadBalancer Cache Configuration>> fields, such as `ttl` and `capacity`.

==== Default LoadBalancer Cache Implementation

If you do not have Caffeine in the classpath, the `DefaultLoadBalancerCache`, which comes automatically with `spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer`, will be used.
See the <<loadbalancer-cache-configuration, LoadBalancerCacheConfiguration>> section for information on how to configure it.

TIP: To use Caffeine instead of the default cache, add the `com.github.ben-manes.caffeine:caffeine` dependency to classpath.

[[loadbalancer-cache-configuration]]
==== LoadBalancer Cache Configuration

You can set your own `ttl` value (the time after write after which entries should be expired), expressed as `Duration`, by passing a `String` compliant with the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-conversion-duration[Spring Boot `String` to `Duration` converter syntax].
as the value of the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.cache.ttl` property.
You can also set your own LoadBalancer cache initial capacity by setting the value of the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.cache.capacity` property.

The default setup includes `ttl` set to 35 seconds and the default `initialCapacity` is `256`.

You can also altogether disable loadBalancer caching by setting the value of `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.cache.enabled`
to `false`.

WARNING: Although the basic, non-cached, implementation is useful for prototyping and testing, it's much less efficient than the cached versions, so we recommend always using the cached version in production.

=== Zone-Based Load-Balancing

To enable zone-based load-balancing, we provide the `ZonePreferenceServiceInstanceListSupplier`.
We use `DiscoveryClient`-specific `zone` configuration (for example, `eureka.instance.metadata-map.zone`) to pick the zone that the client tries to filter available service instances for.

NOTE: You can also override `DiscoveryClient`-specific zone setup by setting the value of `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.zone` property.

WARNING: For the time being, only Eureka Discovery Client is instrumented to set the LoadBalancer zone. For other discovery client, set the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.zone` property. More instrumentations coming shortly.

NOTE: To determine the zone of a retrieved `ServiceInstance`, we check the value under the `"zone"` key in its metadata map.

The `ZonePreferenceServiceInstanceListSupplier` filters retrieved instances and only returns the ones within the same zone.
If the zone is `null` or there are no instances within the same zone, it returns all the retrieved instances.

In order to use the zone-based load-balancing approach, you will have to instantiate a `ZonePreferenceServiceInstanceListSupplier` bean in a <<custom-loadbalancer-configuration,custom configuration>>.

We use delegates to work with `ServiceInstanceListSupplier` beans.
We suggest passing a `DiscoveryClientServiceInstanceListSupplier` delegate in the constructor of `ZonePreferenceServiceInstanceListSupplier` and, in turn, wrapping the latter with a `CachingServiceInstanceListSupplier` to leverage <<loadbalancer-caching, LoadBalancer caching mechanism>>.

You could use this sample configuration to set it up:

[[zoned-based-custom-loadbalancer-configuration]]
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class CustomLoadBalancerConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public ServiceInstanceListSupplier discoveryClientServiceInstanceListSupplier(
			ConfigurableApplicationContext context) {
		return ServiceInstanceListSuppliers.builder()
					.withDiscoveryClient()
					.withZonePreference()
					.withCaching()
					.build(context);
	}
}
----

=== Instance Health-Check for LoadBalancer

It is possible to enable a scheduled HealthCheck for the LoadBalancer. The `HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier`
is provided for that. It regularly verifies if the instances provided by a delegate
`ServiceInstanceListSupplier` are still alive and only returns the healthy instances,
unless there are none - then it returns all the retrieved instances.

TIP: This mechanism is particularly helpful while using the `SimpleDiscoveryClient`. For the
clients backed by an actual Service Registry, it's not necessary to use, as we already get
healthy instances after querying the external ServiceDiscovery.

TIP:: This supplier is also recommended for setups with a small number of instances per service
in order to avoid retrying calls on a failing instance.

`HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier` uses properties prefixed with
`spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check`. You can set the `initialDelay` and `interval`
for the scheduler. You can set the default path for the healthcheck URL by setting
the value of the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.path.default`. You can also set a specific value
for any given service by setting the value of the `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.path.[SERVICE_ID]`, substituting the `[SERVICE_ID]` with the correct ID of your service. If the path is not set, `/actuator/health` is used by default.

TIP:: If you rely on the default path (`/actuator/health`), make sure you add `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to your collaborator's dependencies, unless you are planning to add such an endpoint on your own.

In order to use the health-check scheduler approach, you will have to instantiate a `HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier` bean in a <<custom-loadbalancer-configuration,custom configuration>>.

We use delegates to work with `ServiceInstanceListSupplier` beans.
We suggest passing a `DiscoveryClientServiceInstanceListSupplier` delegate in the constructor of `HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier`.

You could use this sample configuration to set it up:

[[health-check-based-custom-loadbalancer-configuration]]
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class CustomLoadBalancerConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public ServiceInstanceListSupplier discoveryClientServiceInstanceListSupplier(
			ConfigurableApplicationContext context) {
		return ServiceInstanceListSupplier.builder()
					.withDiscoveryClient()
					.withHealthChecks()
					.build(context);
	    }
	}
----

NOTE:: `HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier` has its own caching mechanism based on Reactor Flux `replay()`, therefore, if it's being used, you may want to skip wrapping that supplier with `CachingServiceInstanceListSupplier`.


[[spring-cloud-loadbalancer-starter]]
=== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer Starter

We also provide a starter that allows you to easily add Spring Cloud LoadBalancer in a Spring Boot app.
In order to use it, just add `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer` to your Spring Cloud dependencies in your build file.

NOTE: Spring Cloud LoadBalancer starter includes
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-caching.html[Spring Boot Caching]
and https://github.com/stoyanr[Evictor].

WARNING: If you have both Ribbon and Spring Cloud LoadBalancer int the classpath, in order to maintain backward compatibility, Ribbon-based implementations will be used by default.
In order to switch to using Spring Cloud LoadBalancer under the hood, make sure you set the property `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.ribbon.enabled` to `false`.

[[custom-loadbalancer-configuration]]
=== Passing Your Own Spring Cloud LoadBalancer Configuration

You can also use the `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation to pass your own load-balancer client configuration, passing the name of the load-balancer client and the configuration class, as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
@LoadBalancerClient(value = "stores", configuration = CustomLoadBalancerConfiguration.class)
public class MyConfiguration {

	@Bean
	@LoadBalanced
	public WebClient.Builder loadBalancedWebClientBuilder() {
		return WebClient.builder();
	}
}
----

TIP:: In order to make working on your own LoadBalancer configuration easier, we have added a `builder()` method to the `ServiceInstanceListSupplier` class.

TIP:: You can also use our alternative predefined configurations in place of the default ones by setting the value of `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.configurations` property to `zone-preference` to use `ZonePreferenceServiceInstanceListSupplier` with caching or to `health-check` to use `HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier` with caching.
====

You can use this feature to instantiate different implementations of `ServiceInstanceListSupplier` or `ReactorLoadBalancer`, either written by you, or provided by us as alternatives (for example `ZonePreferenceServiceInstanceListSupplier`) to override the default setup.

You can see an example of a custom configuration <<zoned-based-custom-loadbalancer-configuration,here>>.

NOTE: The annotation `value` arguments (`stores` in the example above) specifies the service id of the service that we should send the requests to with the given custom configuration.

You can also pass multiple configurations (for more than one load-balancer client) through the `@LoadBalancerClients` annotation, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
@LoadBalancerClients({@LoadBalancerClient(value = "stores", configuration = StoresLoadBalancerClientConfiguration.class), @LoadBalancerClient(value = "customers", configuration = CustomersLoadBalancerClientConfiguration.class)})
public class MyConfiguration {

	@Bean
	@LoadBalanced
	public WebClient.Builder loadBalancedWebClientBuilder() {
		return WebClient.builder();
	}
}
----

== Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker

include::spring-cloud-circuitbreaker.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== CachedRandomPropertySource

Spring Cloud Context provides a `PropertySource` that caches random values based on a key.  Outside of the caching
functionality it works the same as Spring Boot's https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/env/RandomValuePropertySource.java[`RandomValuePropertySource`].
This random value might be useful in the case where you want a random value that is consistent even after the Spring Application
context restarts.  The property value takes the form of `cachedrandom.[yourkey].[type]` where `yourkey` is the key in the cache.  The `type` value can
be any type supported by Spring Boot's `RandomValuePropertySource`.

====
