/**
 * A {@link BeanLifecycleDecorator} that tries to protect against concurrent access to a bean during its own destruction.
 * A read-write lock is used, and method access is protected using the read lock, while the destruction callback is
 * protected more strictly with the write lock. In this way concurrent access is possible to the bean as long as it is
 * not being destroyed, in which case only one thread has access. If the bean has no destruction callback the lock and
 * associated proxies are never created.
