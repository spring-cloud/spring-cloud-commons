/**
 * <p>
 * A Scope implementation that allows for beans to be refreshed dynamically at runtime
 * (see {@link #refresh(String)} and {@link #refreshAll()}). If a bean is refreshed then
 * the next time the bean is accessed (i.e. a method is executed) a new instance is
 * created. All lifecycle methods are applied to the bean instances, so any destruction
 * callbacks that were registered in the bean factory are called when it is refreshed, and
 * then the initialization callbacks are invoked as normal when the new instance is
 * created. A new bean instance is created from the original bean definition, so any
 * externalized content (property placeholders or expressions in string literals) is
 * re-evaluated when it is created.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that all beans in this scope are <em>only</em> initialized when first accessed, so
 * the scope forces lazy initialization semantics. The implementation involves creating a
 * proxy for every bean in the scope, so there is a flag
 * {@link #setProxyTargetClass(boolean) proxyTargetClass} which controls the proxy
 * creation, defaulting to JDK dynamic proxies and therefore only exposing the interfaces
 * implemented by a bean. If callers need access to other methods then the flag needs to
 * be set (and CGLib present on the classpath). Because this scope automatically proxies
 * all its beans, there is no need to add <code>&lt;aop:auto-proxy/&gt;</code> to any bean
 * definitions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The scoped proxy approach adopted here has a side benefit that bean instances are
 * automatically {@link Serializable}, and can be sent across the wire as long as the
 * receiver has an identical application context on the other side. To ensure that the two
 * contexts agree that they are identical they have to have the same serialization id. One
 * will be generated automatically by default from the bean names, so two contexts with
 * the same bean names are by default able to exchange beans by name. If you need to
 * override the default id then provide an explicit {@link #setId(String) id} when the
 * Scope is declared.
 * </p>
